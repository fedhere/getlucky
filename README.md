lucky imaging software, designed for the LCOGT LIHSP (Lucky Imaging and High Speed Photometry) systems.

at this point, i have only imported the pipeline. instructions and modifications to make it user friendly are needed. But basic help is provided throughout the code.

This code was built as a data reduction package for the LCOGT LIHSP camera data, but it should work with few modifications with YOUR high speed photoemtry data as well.
